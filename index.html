									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>I’ve always been excited to start university 
									and now that I’m here it’s such a strange feeling.
									Getting used to uni-life is going to be a major transition in my life.
									My name is Nik I’m 18 years old, I have two brothers one older and the other younger.
									We’ve been in Melbourne my entire life. Although I come from Australia and was born here my father is Hungarian.
									I have a part time job working at our local pizza shop where I manage the phone calls, the restaurant, front counter and online orders.
									When I’m not working, I’m enjoying gaming, hanging out with friends, cycling and watching movies/TV Shows some of my favorites are Blade runner (Both the original and sequel), Arrival, Alien and spirited away.
									As you can tell from this list, I like sci-fi, in this genre development of computer science is explored in a fantasy setting and analyzed through characters perspective of the world.
									One of my favorite books is A Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.
									This book explores a technologically advanced utopian version of the world we live in today, this is very much the opposite of most sci-fi films based on a dystopian world.
									Watching and reading this media opened my mind to all the possibilities for the future of technology. However, my interest in IT started before I was introduced into the sci-fi genre.
									I’ve been interested in IT since I was very little, involving myself with the computer whenever I could. I would explore windows and fiddle with every little setting.
									I remember when I was little kid I somehow managed to open all exe files with notepad and 10-year-old me was trying so hard to find a fix to it before my dad used the computer knowing that he would not let me back on the computer after messing it up.
									I can’t remember if I ever found the fix for it, but it stopped me from playing some of my favorite computer games. Well I must have survived without them because I’m here now studying at RMIT.
									I’m going to be honest RMIT was not my first preference, but it was still amazing that I got accepted into the course. </p>

							<p>These results tell me about how I should approach life, in terms of education and socializing. The first test states that I’m a meditator which I agree with to a certain extent, while I do believe in the good of the worst people or events this is not always the case, in a teamwork environment I help keep up moral and encourage people to reach their potential. My learning style test states that I’m an auditory learner so listing to lectures and reading aloud is the optimal way for me to learn. Some recommendations for auditory learners are: Watching lecture recordings over and over, Listing to classic music and repeating facts aloud.

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<img src= "images/pic02.png" style = "width:25%" align = "right">
							<p>Source: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38239644?searchrequesttoken=7133867a-f-47d1-bc7e-6edd1e97a4d4&type=standout">Here</a></p>
									<h3>Technology People</h3>
									<p>My ideal job would be programming in a large corporation. Salary isn’t a main concern of my options,
									more the ability to work in a team-based environment to create a large scale program with work split between groups and individual work.
									A job I found online is one at Technology people as a software engineer, it lists that the applicant must be able to think outside of the box,
									Work closely with a team of highly skilled consultant engineers to deliver ground breaking software solutions,
									test everything and continually evolve the software development team processes. 
									An occupation like this would be perfect for me because I enjoy the mix of teamwork and individual work,
									being able to work out solutions with a group is a positive.
									This job requires the applicant to have 3-5 years in java programming which can be achieved through my course and learning java through the eclipse workspace,
									it also requires some knowledge in other languages such as Python and Scala. I have little experience in python and no experience in Scala but would be willing to learn them out of personal interest,
									being able to develop my skills in other programming languages is something that I aspire to do.
									</p>
									<h3>Current Experiance</h3>
									<p>Currently I know little about java or Scala but I have learnt python throughout my years of high school and have learnt how to make basis programs with functioning ui, for example a project we had to do invovled making a invoice system for a computer parts store and i was Successfully able to make a program that could satisfy all the needs of the user. </p

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<h3>Overview of project</h3>
									<p>My project is a mass sorting system for files. The project will display a file visually and allows the user to drag that file into sub folders. The program must allow the users to select multiple files, create multiple folders, delete folders, view images and videos via a thumbnail and allow users to drag their files into folders. The program should be easy to use for someone who has basic knowledge of computer systems. The program must also be quick. The user must have the ability to select the directory of the files waiting to be sorted. The motivation behind this program is the vast amount of photos, videos and other files being stored on pc’s around the world and a lack of sorting options limits the user forcing them to make folders for each one in the windows explorer. This program is aimed at people who store movies and photos on their pc’s and have them scattered everywhere. The program fills in the much-needed sorting system that windows explorer lacks. </p>
									<h3>Detailed Description</h3>
									<p>The program starts of by asking the user to select a directory for the files they are wanting to sort. This will open a browse popup and lets the user select the folder. Once the folder is selected the program displays each file as a thumbnail in the middle of the screen, below the file is the name of it. Above this there is a scrollbar for each of the folders the user can drag the file into, these folders are loaded from a source folder defined by the user. The user will also have the ability to create a new folder, once created it will be added to the top bar. This bar will expand as the user adds a folder. The program will also have the ability to create default folders for the user, for example if the user is sorting movies it will make folders for each genre romance, sci-fi, comedy, animation… The program will continue to display a file until all files are moved out of the folder. The program will also allow the user to automatically sort by file types for example if there are multiple text files it will move them into a folder label “Text Files”. The program will follow the basic layout functions set by windows such as the layout of minimize, maximize and close buttons and the icons from windows 10 such as folders and thumbnails. The program will not be resource heavy and should be able to run on any laptop or pc despite it’s processing power. Users will have the ability to load previous folder layouts and save them. </p>
									<h3>Tools and Technology Required</h3>
									<p>This program will require a windows system and java on the users computer. To develop the soloution eclipse will need to be installed and use of github to store the code and retrieve it. The program will not require a powerfull computer to run and should be able to run on most modern computers.</p>
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>When the program is finished it should be able to successfully let the user fix their problems of messy folders with no organization. If the program functions as intended being able to find a movie, image, document or any other file type will be made a lot easier than previously and the user will be able to move the categories around and store them in different locations and use them with other computer systems like home pc’s or ipods.</p>
